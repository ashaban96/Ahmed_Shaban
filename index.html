    <h1> Ahmed Shaban </h1>
    <p style="color:black;"> I am a PhD student at the physics department at NC State university. My reseach area is Extragalactic astronomy and galaxy evolution. I am working on the study of galactic outflows in gravitationally lensed galaxies using integral field unit (IFU) spectrographs (e.g. MUSE-VLT, KCWI-Keck, etc). I work under the supervision of Dr. Rongmon Bordoloi.
    I have a bachelor degree in physics with a concentration in astrophysics from the University of Science and Technology at Zewail City in Egypt.  </p>
